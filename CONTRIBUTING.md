# Contributing

First off thank you for considering contributing to this project! 

There are a few ways you can contribute to DynamicGui. 
* The first is [filling issue reports](https://github.com/ClubObsidian/DynamicGui/issues), which is a great help to improve stability and add new features to DynamicGui. 
* The second way you can contribute is by submitting code. 
  * We accept most contributions which do not break backwards compatability. DynamicGui should not have any hard dependencies on plugins on build-time or run-time. Please use reflection if you want or need a plugin dependency. If you are writing against a plugin dependency a [registry](https://github.com/ClubObsidian/DynamicGui/tree/master/src/main/java/com/clubobsidian/dynamicgui/registry) should be created so that similar plugins can add compability. 
 
**Please note before your code will be accepted please sign our [CLA.](https://cla-assistant.io/ClubObsidian/DynamicGui)**
